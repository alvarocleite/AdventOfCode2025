AdventOfCode2025 contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 puzzles. 

All solutions are implemented in Python and are developed with the assistance of AI (Gemini CLI) to help draft approaches, and speed up the learning process. Each solution is manually written and refined with help of Gemini.

**Overview**

- **Language:** Python
- **AI Assistance:** Gemini CLI
- **Purpose:** Solve Advent of Code 2025 puzzles with AI-assisted coding.

**Learning Goals**

My primary objective is to master Python. Specifically, I focus on:
- **Syntax Mastery:** Gaining fluency in Python's syntax.
- **Complex Concepts:** Understanding and applying advanced topics (e.g., generators, decorators, data structures).
- **Clean Code:** Writing readable, maintainable, and "Pythonic" code adhering to clean code principles.

**Project structure (planned)**

- Solutions will be organized by day (`day01/`, `day02/`, ...).
- Each day should include the puzzle input and the code to solve the problem.

**Quick start**

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies (if any):

```bash
python -m venv aoc2025env
source aoc2025env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `aoc2025env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt   # if a requirements file exists
```

2. Run a solution (example):

```bash
python dayXX/dayXX.py
```

**AI assistance details**

This repository uses the Gemini CLI as a code partner and mentor. The workflow involves:
- **Mentorship:** Asking for explanations of complex concepts and Python syntax.
- **Code Reviews:** Submitting solutions for review to ensure adherence to clean code principles and identify areas for improvement.
- **Problem Solving:** Collaborating on logic and approaches while ensuring the final implementation is manually written to reinforce learning.
